# Collection-Service-Work
A collection of back end code I worked on that helped query Amazon endpoints and return key business data.
This project was a group project at work, and I cannot take credit for every little piece.
I did work on a lot of the code that is posted in this repo.

The idea behind these code snippets is to accept some incoming parameters such as start and end dates, reportTypes, etc. send a query to an Amazon endpoint to get Amazon to start generating a business report, continually check back with the endpoint, and evenetually return the data once the report is ready.
